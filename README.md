# Artificial Intelligence with Gomuku
The aim of the coding is to design an AI, name as Southampton Go, on the adversarial game Gomoku on the standard rule, which is a popular strategy logic board game in the world. In the nineteenth century, the game was introduced to Britain where it was known as Go Bang or Pegity. The game is played by two persons, with black and white stone on a 15x15 grid intersection chessboard. Players place the stone with their colour on an empty intersection alternate until an unbroken chain of Ô¨Åve or more has been made at horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The Strategy of AI is to implement the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and the Monte Carlo method (MCM) to evaluate the current chessboard winning percentage.
